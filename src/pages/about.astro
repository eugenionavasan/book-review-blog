      <div class="prose">
        <p>Welcome to my book review blog! I created this space to share my thoughts, impressions, and ratings of the books I read. As an avid reader, I believe that books have the power to transform our perspectives, expand our knowledge, and take us on incredible journeys.</p>
        
        <h2>My Rating System</h2>
        <p>I rate books on a scale of 1 to 5 stars:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>5 stars:</strong> Exceptional. These books changed how I think or feel. I would read them again and recommend them to everyone.</li>
          <li><strong>4 stars:</strong> Great. I thoroughly enjoyed these books and would recommend them to others who enjoy the genre.</li>
          <li><strong>3 stars:</strong> Good. Solid books that were worth reading but had some issues or didn't fully resonate with me.</li>
          <li><strong>2 stars:</strong> Okay. These books had significant problems but may still appeal to certain readers.</li>
          <li><strong>1 star:</strong> Poor. Books I struggled to finish and wouldn't recommend.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I often use half-star ratings when a book falls between two categories.</p>
        
        <h2>Genres I Enjoy</h2>
        <p>While I read across many genres, I particularly enjoy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Literary fiction</li>
          <li>Science fiction and fantasy</li>
          <li>Historical fiction</li>
          <li>Popular science</li>
          <li>Philosophy and psychology</li>
        </ul>
